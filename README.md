# Back end challenge - Clean Arch + Node + MongoDB

This repository was built for Tractian Challenge as described in [this link](https://tractian.notion.site/Back-End-Software-Engineer-584a6e7bbd8b4ef48fc1e59ce0f964fc).

Backend deploy was done throught Heroku + MongoDB Atlas.
Front end, thought, github pages.

(It was deployed to heroku, not anymore)

## Technical requirements are:

- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB
- Clean Architecture

## Technical Decisions

- NestJS:
  - It's really opinionated, it would teach me the node way of doing things, just like Django would teach me the "Pythonic way".  
  - It's inspired by the angular heavy OOP style that fits clean arch paradigm.
  - It's the default framework for node, so it's a good thing to learn it.
  - It has a huge community around it, so it's more resources
  - On the downside, applying clean architecture to it was a bit hard, since it's really opinionated.




## Functional requirements

- Industrial units management system.
- Login, signin and authentication.
- Visualization and editing of  `Industrial units` and `Assets`

## Learning goals and who am I

In the last 3 years, worked as a Django(Python), Vue(Javascript), SQL(PostgreSQL) developer; Django have an MVC/procedural architecture, Vue is based on Flux/Functional architecture and Postgresql have is a SQL database.
Working with Clean architecture/OOP and NO-sql was something new to me.

Besides that, I had to learn.

- TypeScript
- NestJs
- MongoDB
- Clean Architecture
- Node
- OOP design patterns

## What is missing?

- Registering companies was only implemented in the backend.
- Associating users and companies was not done.
- File upload was not done.
- Testing was not done
- Githubpages and SPA with routes is not working 100%, is not workingly. It's not possible to access sub routes directly nor to refresh the page.
- Many other.
